# How to Use the Execution_And_Startup Stage

## Quick Start

The **Execution_And_Startup** stage is the final stage (Stage 7) that generates everything you need to run your generated project.

---

## What It Does

Generates **working startup scripts** and **running instructions** for your project:

- ✅ `start.sh` - One-click startup for Unix/Linux/Mac
- ✅ `start.bat` - One-click startup for Windows
- ✅ `run.py` - Cross-platform Python runner
- ✅ `README_RUN.md` - Complete running instructions
- ✅ `setup_env.sh/.bat` - Environment setup scripts
- ✅ `QUICK_START.md` - Quick start guide

---

## How to Use

### Step 1: Complete All Previous Stages

Execute these stages in order:

1. ✅ Requirements_GatheringAnd_Analysis
2. ✅ Design
3. ✅ Implementation_Development
4. ✅ Testing_Quality_Assurance
5. ✅ Deployment
6. ✅ Maintenance

### Step 2: Execute Execution_And_Startup

1. Open Streamlit interface: http://localhost:8501
2. Scroll to "Execution_And_Startup" subtask
3. Click **"⚡ Build Subtask: Execution_And_Startup"**
4. Wait for completion

### Step 3: View Generated Files

You'll see:

```
📂 Generated Files

Startup Scripts
🚀 start.sh
🚀 start.bat  
🏃 run.py
⚙️ setup_env.sh

Running Instructions
📝 README_RUN.md
📝 QUICK_START.md

Documentation
📝 Execution_And_Startup.md
```

### Step 4: Run Your Project!

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd output/[Your_Project_Name]/Execution_And_Startup/
```

**On Unix/Linux/Mac:**
```bash
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

**On Windows:**
```batch
start.bat
```

**Using Python (cross-platform):**
```bash
python run.py
```

---

## What to Expect

### The Files Work!

- Scripts detect entry points automatically (main.py, app.py, etc.)
- Dependencies are installed from requirements.txt
- Virtual environments are created automatically
- The application starts with proper setup

### Example start.sh:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Starting application..."

# Create virtual environment
if [ ! -d "venv" ]; then
    python3 -m venv venv
fi

# Activate venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the app
python app.py  # ← Your actual entry point!
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No files generated"

**Solution:** The fallback mechanism ensures at least 3 files are always created:
- start.sh
- start.bat
- README_RUN.md

If you see fewer, check Docker logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs backend
```

### Issue: "Script doesn't work"

**Checklist:**
1. ✅ Is the script executable? Run: `chmod +x start.sh`
2. ✅ Are dependencies listed? Check requirements.txt exists
3. ✅ Is Python installed? Run: `python --version`

**Edit the script if needed:**
The generated scripts are templates. Edit them for your specific environment.

### Issue: "Wrong entry point"

**Solution:** 
Edit start.sh and change:
```bash
python app.py
```
to your actual entry point:
```bash
python your_actual_file.py
```

---

## Advanced Usage

### Running in Docker

If your Deployment stage created Docker files:

```bash
cd output/[Project_Name]/Deployment/
docker-compose up
```

### Running with Environment Variables

If your project needs environment variables:

1. Create `.env` file:
   ```
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

2. Run setup script:
   ```bash
   ./setup_env.sh
   ```

3. Then start:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

### Running Tests First

```bash
# Run tests before starting
cd Testing_Quality_Assurance/
python -m pytest

# Then start the app
cd ../Execution_And_Startup/
./start.sh
```

## Understanding Generated Files

### start.sh / start.bat
**Purpose:** Automated startup script  
**Does:**
- Creates virtual environment
- Installs dependencies
- Starts the application

**When to use:** Quick one-click startup

### run.py
**Purpose:** Cross-platform Python runner  
**Does:**
- Checks dependencies
- Sets up environment
- Starts app with options

**When to use:** Need cross-platform compatibility or interactive options

### setup_env.sh / setup_env.bat
**Purpose:** One-time environment setup  
**Does:**
- Installs system dependencies
- Configures environment variables
- Initializes database

**When to use:** First time setup on a new machine

### README_RUN.md
**Purpose:** Complete running instructions  
**Contains:**
- Prerequisites
- Step-by-step setup
- Troubleshooting guide
- Configuration options

**When to use:** Need detailed instructions or help

### QUICK_START.md
**Purpose:** Get running in 60 seconds  
**Contains:**
- Minimal steps to start
- Quick commands
- Essential info only

**When to use:** Already familiar with the setup

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Complete All Previous Stages
The Execution_And_Startup stage works best when all previous stages are complete. It analyzes:
- Implementation files for entry points
- Design files for database setup
- Deployment files for configuration

### 2. Review Generated Scripts
Always review the generated scripts before running in production. They're good starting points but may need customization for your environment.

### 3. Test in Development First
Run the scripts in a development environment before using in production.

### 4. Customize as Needed
The scripts are yours! Edit them to add:
- Additional checks
- Custom logging
- Specific configurations
- Error handling

## Real-World Example

### Generated for "Python Flask API" Project

**What was generated:**

```bash
$ ls Execution_And_Startup/
start.sh
start.bat
run.py
setup_env.sh
setup_env.bat
README_RUN.md
QUICK_START.md
Execution_And_Startup.md
```

**To run the project:**

```bash
$ chmod +x start.sh
$ ./start.sh

Starting application...
Creating virtual environment...
Installing dependencies...
  Installing Flask...
  Installing SQLAlchemy...
  Installing pytest...
Launching app.py...
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
 * Running on http://192.168.1.100:5000
```

**Result:** Flask API running and accessible! ✅

## Benefits

### Before Execution_And_Startup:
```
❌ "How do I run this?"
❌ "What dependencies do I need?"
❌ "Where's the entry point?"
❌ "What's the correct command?"
```

### After Execution_And_Startup:
```
✅ Just run: ./start.sh
✅ Everything is automated
✅ Clear instructions available
✅ Works cross-platform
```

## Integration with Other Stages

The Execution_And_Startup stage **builds upon ALL previous stages**:

| Previous Stage | What It Uses |
|----------------|--------------|
| Requirements | User stories → Understand expected behavior |
| Design | Database schema → Include DB setup commands |
| Implementation | Code files → Detect entry point (app.py, main.py) |
| Testing | Test suites → Can add "run tests" option |
| Deployment | Docker files → Include docker commands |
| Maintenance | Monitoring → Include health check commands |

## FAQs

**Q: Can I run this stage without previous stages?**  
A: Yes, but the scripts will be more generic. Works best with complete previous stages.

**Q: What if my project uses Node.js, not Python?**  
A: The stage adapts! It will generate appropriate scripts for your technology stack.

**Q: Are the scripts production-ready?**  
A: They're good starting points. Review and customize for your production environment.

**Q: Can I regenerate just this stage?**  
A: Yes! Just click the "Build Subtask" button again. It will overwrite previous files.

**Q: What if I hit rate limits?**  
A: The fallback mechanism ensures you still get working scripts! They're more basic but functional.

**Q: How do I customize the scripts?**  
A: The files are in `output/[Project_Name]/Execution_And_Startup/`. Edit them directly.
