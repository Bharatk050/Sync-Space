# Execution and Startup
## Introduction
This document outlines the startup scripts and procedures for the Test_Project_20251028. The goal is to create a production-ready, maintainable, and secure solution that aligns with the requirements from previous stages.

## Directory Structure
The project directory structure is as follows:
```markdown
Test_Project_20251028/
|-- config.yaml
|-- schema.sql
|-- requirements.txt
|-- start.sh
|-- start.bat
|-- README_RUN.md
```
## Startup Scripts
### start.sh (Linux/Mac)
The `start.sh` script is used to start the application on Linux/Mac systems. The script will install the required dependencies, create the database schema, and start the application.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create database schema
mysql -u <username> -p<password> < schema.sql

# Start the application
python app.py
```
### start.bat (Windows)
The `start.bat` script is used to start the application on Windows systems. The script will install the required dependencies, create the database schema, and start the application.
```batch
@echo off

:: Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

:: Create database schema
mysql -u <username> -p<password> < schema.sql

:: Start the application
python app.py
```
## README_RUN.md
The `README_RUN.md` file contains instructions on how to run the application.
```markdown
# Running the Application
To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Create the database schema by running `mysql -u <username> -p<password> < schema.sql`
3. Start the application by running `python app.py`

## Environment Variables
The following environment variables are required:
* `DB_USERNAME`: the username for the database
* `DB_PASSWORD`: the password for the database
* `DB_HOST`: the host for the database
* `DB_PORT`: the port for the database

## Config File
The `config.yaml` file contains the application configuration.
```yml
db:
  username: ${DB_USERNAME}
  password: ${DB_PASSWORD}
  host: ${DB_HOST}
  port: ${DB_PORT}
```
## Schema File
The `schema.sql` file contains the database schema.
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  email VARCHAR(255)
);
```
## Requirements File
The `requirements.txt` file contains the required dependencies.
```
flask
mysql-connector-python
```
## Security Considerations
To ensure the security of the application, the following measures should be taken:

* Use a secure password for the database
* Use a secure connection to the database (e.g. SSL/TLS)
* Validate user input to prevent SQL injection attacks
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks

## Conclusion
The startup scripts and procedures outlined in this document provide a production-ready, maintainable, and secure solution for the Test_Project_20251028. By following the instructions in the `README_RUN.md` file and using the provided scripts, the application can be easily deployed and run. Additionally, the security considerations outlined in this document should be taken into account to ensure the security of the application.
