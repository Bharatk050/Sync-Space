# Requirements_GatheringAnd_Analysis

# Project: Python_HelloPrinter
## Task ID: 1
## Title: Requirements_GatheringAnd_Analysis
## Description: Gather and analyze project requirements, create user stories, and define acceptance criteria

### Introduction
The Python_HelloPrinter project aims to develop a simple Python application that prints "Hello" messages. This document outlines the requirements gathering and analysis process, including user stories, functional and non-functional requirements, and acceptance criteria.

### Requirements Gathering
The project brief (`project_brief.docx`) outlines the overall objective of the project. Key points include:

* Developing a Python application
* Printing "Hello" messages
* Ensuring the application is production-ready, maintainable, and secure

Stakeholder interviews (`stakeholder_interviews.mp3`) provided additional insights:

* The application should be able to print customized "Hello" messages
* The application should be able to handle multiple print requests
* The application should be easy to use and maintain

### User Stories
Based on the requirements gathering process, the following user stories were created:

1. **As a** user, **I want** to be able to print a customized "Hello" message, **so that** I can personalize the output.
2. **As a** user, **I want** to be able to handle multiple print requests, **so that** I can use the application efficiently.
3. **As a** developer, **I want** the application to be easy to maintain and update, **so that** I can ensure the application remains production-ready and secure.

### Functional Requirements
The following functional requirements were identified:

1. The application shall print a customized "Hello" message.
2. The application shall handle multiple print requests.
3. The application shall provide an easy-to-use interface for users.

### Non-Functional Requirements
The following non-functional requirements were identified:

1. **Performance**: The application shall respond to user input within 1 second.
2. **Security**: The application shall ensure that user input is validated and sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities.
3. **Usability**: The application shall provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

### Acceptance Criteria
The acceptance criteria (`acceptance_criteria.docx`) outlines the conditions that must be met for the application to be considered complete. The criteria include:

1. The application prints a customized "Hello" message.
2. The application handles multiple print requests.
3. The application provides an easy-to-use interface.
4. The application responds to user input within 1 second.
5. The application ensures that user input is validated and sanitized.

### Requirements Template
The requirements template (`requirements_template.xlsx`) was used to document the requirements. The template includes the following columns:

* Requirement ID
* Requirement Description
* User Story ID
* Functional/Non-Functional
* Priority
* Status

The template was populated with the requirements gathered during this stage.

### Conclusion
This document outlines the requirements gathering and analysis process for the Python_HelloPrinter project. The user stories, functional and non-functional requirements, and acceptance criteria provide a clear understanding of the project's objectives and constraints. The requirements template ensures that all requirements are documented and tracked throughout the project's lifecycle.

### Next Steps
The next step is to design the application's architecture and implement the requirements. This will involve creating a detailed design document and writing the Python code to meet the requirements.

### Code
The following Python code snippet demonstrates a basic implementation of the "Hello" printer:
```python
def print_hello(name):
    """
    Prints a customized "Hello" message.

    Args:
        name (str): The name to include in the message.
    """
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Example usage:
print_hello("World")
```
This code snippet will be built upon in the next stage to create a fully functional application.

### Diagrams
The following diagram illustrates the application's high-level architecture:
```mermaid

    B -->|Processing|> C[Output]
    C -->|Result|> A
```
This diagram shows the user interacting with the application, providing input, and receiving output.

### Specifications
The following specifications outline the application's technical requirements:

* **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
* **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, Linux
* **Dependencies**: None

These specifications will be used to guide the implementation of the application in the next stage.
