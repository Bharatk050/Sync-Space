# Maintenance

# Maintenance
## Introduction
The Shoe_Store_Hub_20251028_214718 project aims to develop an e-commerce website for a shoe store. This document outlines the maintenance process, including system monitoring, backup procedures, and update protocol. The deliverables for this task include a monitoring dashboard and a backup schedule.

## System Monitoring
To ensure the e-commerce website is running smoothly, we will set up system monitoring using Grafana. Grafana is a popular monitoring platform that provides a customizable dashboard for visualizing metrics and logs.

### Monitoring Dashboard Configuration
The monitoring dashboard will be configured to display the following metrics:
* CPU usage
* Memory usage
* Disk usage
* Network traffic
* Error rates

The dashboard will be designed to provide a clear overview of the system's performance and allow for quick identification of any issues.

### Example Code: Monitoring Dashboard Configuration
```yml
# config.yaml
dashboard:
  title: Shoe Store Hub Monitoring Dashboard
  rows:
    - title: System Metrics
      panels:
        - title: CPU Usage
          type: graph
          span: 4
          targets:
            - target: cpu_usage
        - title: Memory Usage
          type: graph
          span: 4
          targets:
            - target: memory_usage
```

## Backup Procedures
To ensure data integrity and availability, we will configure backup procedures using BackupPC. BackupPC is a popular backup solution that provides a flexible and scalable way to backup and restore data.

### Backup Schedule
The backup schedule will be configured to run daily at 2am, with a retention period of 30 days. The backup will include all database files, configuration files, and user data.

### Example Configuration: Backup Schedule
```bash
# backup_script.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Set backup directory
BACKUP_DIR=/var/backups/shoe_store_hub

# Set database credentials
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_NAME=shoe_store_hub

# Set backup schedule
CRON_SCHEDULE="0 2 * * *"

# Create backup directory
mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR

# Backup database
mysqldump -u $DB_USER -p$DB_PASSWORD $DB_NAME > $BACKUP_DIR/$(date +\%Y-\%m-\%d-\%H-\%M-\%S).sql

# Backup configuration files
cp -r /etc/shoe_store_hub $BACKUP_DIR/

# Backup user data
cp -r /var/www/shoe_store_hub/user_data $BACKUP_DIR/
```

## Update Protocol
To ensure the e-commerce website remains up-to-date and secure, we will implement an update protocol using Ansible. Ansible is a popular automation tool that provides a flexible and scalable way to manage and update infrastructure.

### Update Procedure
The update procedure will be configured to run weekly, with a review and approval process to ensure that all updates are thoroughly tested and validated.

### Example Code: Update Procedure
```yml
# update.yml
---
- name: Update Shoe Store Hub
  hosts: shoe_store_hub
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Update package list
      apt:
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Upgrade packages
      apt:
        upgrade: yes

    - name: Restart services
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: restarted
```

## Validation Steps
To ensure the maintenance process is working as expected, we will perform the following validation steps:
* Verify monitoring dashboard is working
* Verify backup procedures are working
* Verify update protocol is working

### Example Code: Validation Steps
```bash
# validation_script.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Verify monitoring dashboard is working
curl -s -f http://localhost:3000 | grep "Shoe Store Hub Monitoring Dashboard"

# Verify backup procedures are working
ls -l /var/backups/shoe_store_hub | grep "shoe_store_hub"

# Verify update protocol is working
ansible-playbook -i hosts update.yml
```

## Conclusion
In this document, we outlined the maintenance process for the Shoe_Store_Hub_20251028_214718 project, including system monitoring, backup procedures, and update protocol. We provided example code and configurations for each step, and outlined the validation steps to ensure the maintenance process is working as expected. By following this document, we can ensure the e-commerce website remains running smoothly, securely, and efficiently.
