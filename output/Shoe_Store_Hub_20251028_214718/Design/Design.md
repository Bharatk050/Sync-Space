Design Document for Shoe_Store_Hub_20251028_214718
=====================================================

## Introduction
The Shoe_Store_Hub_20251028_214718 project aims to develop an e-commerce website for a shoe store. This design document outlines the system architecture, database schema, and API contract for the website, building upon the requirements gathered and analyzed in the previous stage.

## System Architecture
The system architecture for Shoe_Store_Hub_20251028_214718 is designed to be scalable, secure, and maintainable. The architecture consists of the following components:

* **Frontend**: The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions.
* **Backend**: The backend is built using Python 3.9 and the Flask framework, and is responsible for handling API requests, interacting with the database, and performing business logic.
* **Database**: The database is built using MySQL 8.0, and is responsible for storing and retrieving data for the application.
* **API Gateway**: The API gateway is built using NGINX, and is responsible for routing API requests to the backend and handling security and authentication.

```

## Database Schema
The database schema for Shoe_Store_Hub_20251028_214718 is designed to store data for the application. The schema consists of the following tables:

* **products**: stores information about products, including id, name, description, price, and image.
* **categories**: stores information about categories, including id, name, and description.
* **orders**: stores information about orders, including id, customer_id, order_date, and total.
* **order_items**: stores information about order items, including id, order_id, product_id, and quantity.

### Database Schema Diagram
```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    image VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE categories (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    total DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE order_items (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT
);
```

## API Contract
The API contract for Shoe_Store_Hub_20251028_214718 defines the API endpoints and methods for the application. The API contract consists of the following endpoints:

* **GET /api/products**: retrieves a list of products.
* **GET /api/products/{id}**: retrieves a product by id.
* **POST /api/orders**: creates a new order.
* **GET /api/orders**: retrieves a list of orders.
* **GET /api/orders/{id}**: retrieves an order by id.

## Security Considerations
The application will implement the following security measures:

* **Authentication**: The application will use OAuth 2.0 for authentication.
* **Authorization**: The application will use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for authorization.
* **Data Encryption**: The application will use AES-256 for data encryption.
* **Access Control**: The application will use a firewall and intrusion detection system to control access.

## Conclusion
The design document for Shoe_Store_Hub_20251028_214718 outlines the system architecture, database schema, and API contract for the application. The application is designed to be scalable, secure, and maintainable, and will implement various security measures to protect user data. The API contract defines the API endpoints and methods for the application, and will be used to guide the development of the application.
