# System Architecture Design for Shoe Store Online
## Introduction
The Shoe Store Online project aims to create a scalable and secure e-commerce website. This document outlines the system architecture, database schema, and API contract for the website.

### System Architecture Diagram
The system architecture consists of the following components:
* Load Balancer: Distributes incoming traffic to multiple web servers
* Web Servers: Handle HTTP requests and serve static content
* Application Servers: Run the e-commerce application and handle business logic
* Database Servers: Store and manage data for the application
* Cache Servers: Improve performance by caching frequently accessed data

The system architecture diagram is shown below:

```

## Database Schema
The database schema is designed using MySQL and consists of the following tables:
* **products**: Stores information about products
	+ id (primary key): Unique identifier for each product
	+ name: Name of the product
	+ price: Price of the product
	+ description: Description of the product
* **orders**: Stores information about orders
	+ id (primary key): Unique identifier for each order
	+ customer_id: Foreign key referencing the customers table
	+ order_date: Date the order was placed
	+ total: Total cost of the order
* **customers**: Stores information about customers
	+ id (primary key): Unique identifier for each customer
	+ name: Name of the customer
	+ email: Email address of the customer
	+ password: Password for the customer's account

The database schema diagram is shown in the `database_schema.png` file.

### Example Database Schema Code
```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  customer_id INT NOT NULL,
  order_date DATE NOT NULL,
  total DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id)
);

CREATE TABLE customers (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```

## API Contract
The API contract is defined using RESTful API principles and consists of the following endpoints:
* **GET /api/products**: Retrieves a list of all products
* **GET /api/products/{id}**: Retrieves a single product by ID
* **POST /api/orders**: Creates a new order
* **GET /api/orders**: Retrieves a list of all orders for the current customer
* **GET /api/customers**: Retrieves information about the current customer

### Example API Endpoint Code
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = "mysql://user:password@localhost/db"
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

@app.route("/api/products", methods=["GET"])
def get_products():
    products = Product.query.all()
    return jsonify([product.to_dict() for product in products])

@app.route("/api/orders", methods=["POST"])
def create_order():
    order = Order(customer_id=1, order_date=date.today(), total=100.00)
    db.session.add(order)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify(order.to_dict())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

## Security Considerations
To ensure the security of the application, the following measures will be implemented:
* **Authentication**: Customers will be required to authenticate using a username and password
* **Authorization**: Access to certain endpoints will be restricted based on the customer's role
* **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data, such as passwords and credit card numbers, will be encrypted using SSL/TLS
* **Input Validation**: All user input will be validated to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks

## Conclusion
The system architecture, database schema, and API contract for the Shoe Store Online project have been designed with scalability, security, and maintainability in mind. The application will be built using a microservices architecture, with each component communicating with others using RESTful APIs. The database schema is designed to store information about products, orders, and customers, and the API contract provides endpoints for retrieving and creating data. Security considerations, such as authentication, authorization, data encryption, and input validation, will be implemented to ensure the security of the application.

### Validation Steps
To validate the design document, the following steps will be taken:
1. Review the design document with stakeholders to ensure that it meets the requirements and is feasible to implement.
2. Verify the database schema and API endpoints to ensure that they are correct and functional.

### Configuration Examples
The following configuration examples are provided:
* Database schema example: `products` table with `id`, `name`, and `price` columns
* API endpoint example: `GET /api/products` to retrieve a list of all products

### Code Snippets
The following code snippets are provided:
* Example API endpoint: `GET /api/products` to retrieve a list of all products
* Example database schema code: `CREATE TABLE products ...`
