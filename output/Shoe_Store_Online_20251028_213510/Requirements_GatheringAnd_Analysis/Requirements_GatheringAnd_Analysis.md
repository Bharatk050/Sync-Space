# Requirements_GatheringAnd_Analysis

# Project Overview
## Introduction
The Shoe_Store_Online_20251028_213510 project aims to develop an e-commerce website for an online shoe store. As a Requirements Analyst, the primary objective is to gather and document requirements for the website, including user stories, acceptance criteria, and system specifications analysis.

## Project Scope
The project scope includes the development of a fully functional e-commerce website that allows users to browse and purchase shoes online. The website should have the following features:
* User registration and login functionality
* Product catalog with filtering and sorting options
* Shopping cart and checkout functionality
* Payment gateway integration
* Order management and tracking

## Stakeholders
The stakeholders for this project include:
* Customers: individuals who will be using the website to purchase shoes
* Store owners: individuals who will be managing the website and processing orders
* Developers: individuals who will be developing and maintaining the website
* Quality assurance team: individuals who will be testing and verifying the website

# Requirements Gathering
## User Stories
The following user stories have been identified through stakeholder interviews:
| User Story ID | Description | Acceptance Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| US-1 | As a customer, I want to be able to register for an account so that I can save my personal and payment information. | The system shall allow customers to register for an account with a valid email address and password. The system shall send a confirmation email to the customer's email address. |
| US-2 | As a customer, I want to be able to browse products by category and filter by price and brand so that I can find the products I am interested in. | The system shall display a list of products by category. The system shall allow customers to filter products by price and brand. |
| US-3 | As a customer, I want to be able to add products to my shopping cart and view my cart contents so that I can manage my order. | The system shall allow customers to add products to their shopping cart. The system shall display the cart contents, including product name, price, and quantity. |
| US-4 | As a customer, I want to be able to checkout and pay for my order using a credit card so that I can complete my purchase. | The system shall allow customers to checkout and pay for their order using a credit card. The system shall process the payment and send a confirmation email to the customer. |
| US-5 | As a store owner, I want to be able to manage orders and track inventory so that I can fulfill customer orders. | The system shall allow store owners to view and manage orders. The system shall track inventory levels and alert store owners when products are low in stock. |

## Acceptance Criteria
The acceptance criteria for each user story are defined above. Additionally, the following general acceptance criteria apply to the entire system:
* The system shall be responsive and work on multiple devices and browsers.
* The system shall be secure and protect customer personal and payment information.
* The system shall be scalable and able to handle a large volume of traffic and orders.

## System Specifications
The system specifications for the e-commerce website are as follows:
* Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Back-end: Python, Django
* Database: MySQL
* Payment gateway: Stripe
* Hosting: AWS

# System Design
## Architecture
The system architecture shall consist of the following components:
* Web server: handles HTTP requests and serves web pages
* Application server: handles business logic and interacts with the database
* Database server: stores and manages data
* Payment gateway: processes payments and interacts with the application server

## Data Flow
The data flow for the system shall be as follows:
1. Customer submits a request to the web server.
2. The web server forwards the request to the application server.
3. The application server processes the request and interacts with the database server.
4. The database server retrieves or updates data and sends it back to the application server.
5. The application server sends the response back to the web server.
6. The web server sends the response back to the customer.

## Security
The system shall implement the following security measures:
* SSL/TLS encryption for all communication between the customer's browser and the web server
* Password hashing and salting for customer passwords
* Validation and sanitization of all user input
* Regular security updates and patches for all components

# Testing and Validation
## Test Plan
The test plan for the system shall include the following tests:
* Unit tests: test individual components and functions
* Integration tests: test how components interact with each other
* System tests: test the entire system end-to-end
* Acceptance tests: test the system against the acceptance criteria

## Validation Steps
The validation steps for the system shall include:
1. Review the requirements document with stakeholders to ensure that the system meets the requirements.
2. Verify the user stories and acceptance criteria to ensure that the system meets the requirements.
3. Test the system against the test plan to ensure that it works as expected.
4. Conduct security testing to ensure that the system is secure.

# Conclusion
The Shoe_Store_Online_20251028_213510 project requires a comprehensive e-commerce website with user registration, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout functionality. The system shall be secure, scalable, and responsive. The requirements document, user stories, and system specifications have been defined and documented. The system design and architecture have been outlined, and the testing and validation plan has been defined. The next step is to begin development and testing of the system.
