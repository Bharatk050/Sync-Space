# Execution_And_Startup

Execution and Startup
======================
### Introduction
This document outlines the execution and startup procedures for the Python_Hello_Printer_20251028_215535 project. The project aims to create a simple Python program that prints "hello world" to the console.

### Prerequisites
As outlined in the [Requirements_GatheringAnd_Analysis/README.md](Requirements_GatheringAnd_Analysis/README.md) and [Requirements_GatheringAnd_Analysis/requirements_document.txt](Requirements_GatheringAnd_Analysis/requirements_document.txt), the prerequisites for this project are:
* Install Python and a text editor as prerequisites.

### Startup Scripts
To ensure a production-ready, maintainable, and secure solution, we will create startup scripts for both Unix-based systems (start.sh) and Windows (start.bat).

#### start.sh
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Navigate to the project directory
cd /path/to/Python_Hello_Printer_20251028_215535

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run the Python program
python hello_world.py
```

#### start.bat
```batch
@echo off

:: Navigate to the project directory
cd C:\path\to\Python_Hello_Printer_20251028_215535

:: Activate the virtual environment
call venv\Scripts\activate

:: Run the Python program
python hello_world.py
```

### README_RUN.md
To provide clear instructions on how to run the project, we will create a README_RUN.md file with the following content:
```markdown
# README_RUN

## Introduction
This document outlines the steps to run the Python_Hello_Printer_20251028_215535 project.

## Prerequisites
* Install Python and a text editor as prerequisites.

## Running the Project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Activate the virtual environment using `source venv/bin/activate` (Unix-based systems) or `call venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows).
4. Run the Python program using `python hello_world.py`.
5. Verify that the output is indeed "hello world".
```

### Dockerization
As outlined in the [Requirements_GatheringAnd_Analysis/docker-compose.yml](Requirements_GatheringAnd_Analysis/docker-compose.yml), we will use Docker to containerize the project. The docker-compose.yml file will remain unchanged:
```yml
version: "3"
services:
  hello-world:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    restart: always
```

### Validation
To ensure that the project meets the acceptance criteria outlined in the [Requirements_GatheringAnd_Analysis/acceptance_criteria.json](Requirements_GatheringAnd_Analysis/acceptance_criteria.json), we will perform the following validation steps:
1. Verify that the output is indeed "hello world".
2. Verify that the project is production-ready, maintainable, and secure.

By following these steps and using the provided startup scripts, the project can be executed and validated to ensure that it meets the requirements outlined in the previous stages.
