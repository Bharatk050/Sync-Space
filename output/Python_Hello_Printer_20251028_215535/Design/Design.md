System Architecture Design for Python Hello World Printer
=====================================================

### Introduction

This document outlines the system architecture design for the Python Hello World Printer project. The goal of this project is to create a simple Python program that prints "hello world" to the console. The design will build upon the previous stage files and ensure continuity and consistency.

### System Architecture Diagram

The system architecture diagram is as follows:
```markdown
+---------------+
|  User Request  |
+---------------+
           |
           |
           v
+---------------+
|  Docker Container  |
|  (hello-world)    |
+---------------+
           |
           |
           v
+---------------+
|  Python Application  |
|  (hello_world.py)    |
+---------------+
           |
           |
           v
+---------------+
|  Console Output    |
|  ("hello world")  |
+---------------+
```
The system architecture consists of the following components:

*   User Request: The user initiates the request to print "hello world" to the console.
*   Docker Container (hello-world): The Docker container runs the Python application.
*   Python Application (hello\_world.py): The Python application prints "hello world" to the console.
*   Console Output: The output of the Python application is displayed on the console.

### Database Schema

Since the Python Hello World Printer project does not require any data storage, a database schema is not necessary. The project only prints a fixed string to the console.

### API Contract

The API contract for the Python Hello World Printer project is as follows:

*   **Endpoint:** `/hello`
*   **Method:** `GET`
*   **Response:** `hello world`
*   **Status Code:** `200 OK`

The API contract is simple and only includes one endpoint to print "hello world" to the console.

### Implementation Details

The implementation details are as follows:

*   The Python application uses the `print()` function to print "hello world" to the console.
*   The Docker container runs the Python application and exposes port 80.
*   The user can access the API endpoint by sending a GET request to `http://localhost:80/hello`.

### Code Snippets

The code snippets are as follows:

**hello\_world.py**
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/hello', methods=['GET'])
def print_hello_world():
    """Prints 'hello world' to the console."""
    print('hello world')
    return 'hello world'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80)
```

**docker-compose.yml**
```yml
version: "3"
services:
  hello-world:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    restart: always
```

**requirements.txt**
```
flask
```

### Validation Steps

The validation steps are as follows:

1.  Verify that the output of the Python application is indeed "hello world".
2.  Verify that the API endpoint returns a status code of 200 OK.
3.  Verify that the Docker container runs the Python application correctly.

### Conclusion

The system architecture design for the Python Hello World Printer project is complete. The design includes a system architecture diagram, database schema, API contract, implementation details, code snippets, and validation steps. The project is production-ready, maintainable, and secure.
