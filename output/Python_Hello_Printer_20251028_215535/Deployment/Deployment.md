# Deployment

# Deployment
The deployment process for the Python Hello World Printer project involves configuring the infrastructure, setting up a deployment pipeline, and implementing monitoring.

## Infrastructure Configuration
The infrastructure configuration is based on the `docker-compose.yml` file provided in the previous stage. The file defines a service called `hello-world` that builds the Docker image from the current directory and maps port 80 of the container to port 80 of the host machine.

## Deployment Pipeline
The deployment pipeline is configured using GitHub Actions. The pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment process.

## Monitoring Implementation
The monitoring implementation is based on Prometheus and Grafana. Prometheus is used to collect metrics from the application, and Grafana is used to visualize the metrics.
